# Elements of a Crime

To establish criminal culpability in any criminal case, the prosecution must prove (1) actus reus, (2) mens rea, and (3) causation beyond a reasonable doubt.

If it is a result crime, we do not need to prove causation.

*EXAM TIP: The Model Penal Code (MPC) is a minority rule. You should only apply it if the question directs you to do so. Otherwise, you should apply the majority rule, which is often the modern rule, or the common law (CL) rule if there is no modern majority rule.*

# Actus Reus

Actus reus requires (1) the satisfaction of all statutory actus reus elements, and (2) a voluntary act or an omission of a duty to act.

---

## Statutory Actus Reus Elements

**Steps of Analysis:**

1. Elementize the statute
2. Categorize each element (conduct, result, attendant circumstances)
3. Write a law-because-facts sentence analyzing each element

People v. Rizzo (1927) (Rizzo and others driving around trying to find Rao to rob him of payroll. Never found Rao.) Rule: A defendant may not be convicted of attempt unless the defendant intentionally commits an act tending to the commission of a crime, which is so near to accomplishment of the crime that in all reasonable probability the crime itself would have been committed but for timely interference. (This becomes the dangerous proximity test)

State v. Jack Sawyer (2018) (planned a shooting at former high school; question is whether was attempting to commit a crime) (No dangerous proximity) Rule: Intent to commit a crime is not sufficient for conviction of attempt to commit a crime; if there is no actus reus there is no crime (my rule).

---

## Voluntary Act

A voluntary act is a bodily movement performed consciously as a result of effort or determination.

A voluntary act includes the possession of property if the actor was aware of his physical possession or in control of the property for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate it.

The following are not voluntary acts: reflex or convulsion; bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep; conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion; bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

A conditioned response is voluntary.

Coercion does not make something involuntary.

*Martin v State* (1944) (involuntarily and forcibly taken onto public highway by law enforcement officers after being arrested) Rule: Voluntary appearance in a public place is required to convict a person of intoxication in a public place.

*People v. Decina* (NY) (1956) (Decina voluntarily got in the car but did not voluntarily have a seizure) Rule: The definition of voluntary does not have any knowledge requirement.

---

## Omission of Duty

In order to punish a person for an omission, the person must owe a legal duty to the victim, not just a moral duty.

**Examples of duties:** Statutory duties (law enforcement); Legal duty by contract (lifeguard/nursing home); Status relationship (husband/wife, parent/child); Voluntary undertaking to rescue that is abandoned; Failing to help after creating risk (hit & run).

*People v. Beardsley* (1907) (married bartender went on drinking binge with Blanche Burns, who took morphine tablets and died; bartender no duty to care for Blanche Burns)

---

# Mens Rea

A defendant is not guilty of an offense, even if she has a culpable frame of mind, if she lacks the mental state specified in the definition of the crime.

---

## Model Penal Code Mens Rea

A person is not guilty of an offense unless he acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with respect to each material element of the offense.[^1]

[^1]:MPC Section 2.02 General Requirements of Culpability

---

## Kinds of Culpability Defined

**Purposely** is when the conscious objective of the act is to bring about the prohibited result.

**Knowingly** is when the defendant knows, with almost absolute certainty, that the act will produce the prohibited result.

**Recklessly** is when the defendant is aware that the conduct creates an unjustifiable risk, but ignores that risk and engages in the conduct anyway.

**Criminal Negligence** is when the defendant should have been aware that conduct creates an unjustifiable risk, but is not aware and engages in the conduct. Reasonable person standard.

Some terms refer to multiple categories:

**Intent:** Acts intentionally with purpose or knowledge.

**Willful:** Acts purposely or knowingly, with moral turpitude (similar to intent).

## New York Penal Law Mens Rea

(1) Intentionally

A person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct.

(2) Knowingly

A person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware that his conduct is of such nature or that such circumstances exist.

(3) Recklessly

A person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists.  The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.  A person who creates such a risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of voluntary intoxication also acts recklessly with respect thereto.

(4) Criminal Negligence

A person acts with criminal negligence with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists.  The risk must be of such nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.

NYPL Section 15.05

## Types of Intent

Specific intent requires proof that the defendant intended to create a specifically prohibited harm; includes acts done purposefully or knowingly (“with intent to”).

Nullified by an honest but unreasonable mistake of fact or by voluntary intoxication.

General intent only requires a desire to do the prohibited act; includes reckless and negligent states of mind.

Nullified by an honest and reasonable mistake of fact.

Strict liability has no mens rea element. If the actus reus element is satisfied, the defendant is guilty.

Mistake of fact is never a defense (e.g., mistake of fact not a defense for statutory rape, where the defendant mistakenly believes the victim was of legal age).

Transferred intent occurs when the defendant intends to produce a criminal result against one party, but harms another instead. The intent transfers from the intended victim to the unintended victim.

Concurrence requires the prosecution to prove that the act that caused the criminal result was actuated (set in motion) by the requisite criminal state of mind.

EXAMPLE: Common law burglary is the unlawful breaking and entering of the dwelling of another at night with the intent “to commit a felony or larceny therein.” If the defendant breaks into a house to escape from the rain, and then sees a valuable item and decides to steal it before he leaves, this is NOT burglary because the breaking and entering was not actuated by the requisite mens rea – there is no concurrence. Burglary requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant broke and entered the dwelling with the intent to commit a felony or larceny once inside. Here, the intent was formed after the entry, so there is no burglary.

## Classification of Crimes

| Specific Intent Crimes | General Intent Crimes | Malice Crimes | Strict Liability Crimes |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Attempt, solicitation, conspiracy, larceny, larceny by trick, false pretenses, embezzlement, forgery, burglary, assault, robbery, intent to kill murder, voluntary manslaughter | battery, rape, kidnapping, involuntary manslaughter, depraved-heart murder, false imprisonment | Arson, common law murder | Regulatory offenses (e.g., traffic violations, vehicle offenses, failure to comply with administrative statutes), public welfare offenses (e.g., selling alcohol to minors, failure to comply with regulations of firearms, food and drugs), morality crimes (e.g., statutory rape, bigamy) |



# Causation

To prove causation, the prosecution must prove that the defendant’s act was the actual cause and the proximate cause of the harm.

## Actual cause

Actual cause can be satisfied by one of three tests.

**But-For test:** The result would not have occurred but for the defendant’s conduct.

**Substantial Factor test:** Multiple causes/parties are responsible for the result, but the defendant’s act was a substantial factor in causing the criminal result.

**Acceleration test:** The defendant’s conduct speeds up an inevitable death, even if briefly.

EXAMPLE: D1 stabs the victim in the heart with a knife. Simultaneous with this stabbing, D2 shoots the victim in the head. Medical testimony conclusively establishes that either the knife or bullet wound alone was sufficient cause to instantly kill the victim. Either D1 or D2’s act can be considered the actual cause of the victim’s death.

EXAMPLE: D1 shoots the victim in the chest. D2 then runs over the victim and kills him instantly. Medical evidence establishes that the victim would have died from the gunshot wound, but that he died more quickly as the result of being run over. Both D1 and D2 are substantial factors, and D2 is an accelerating factor.

## Proximate Cause

Proximate cause requires the resultant harm to be within the risk created by the defendant’s conduct in crimes involving criminal negligence or recklessness, or sufficiently similar to that intended in crimes requiring intent.

A superseding intervening cause relieves the defendant of responsibility and breaks the casual connection to the criminal result.

If the intervening event is foreseeable, it will not supersede. The defendant is still responsible.

If the intervening event is unforeseeable, it normally will supersede.

### Assessing Foreseeability

To determine whether the intervening cause was a dependent or responsive intervening cause, or merely a coincidence.

Dependent or responsive interventions will not supersede, unless they are a totally abnormal response to the defendant’s act.

Independent/coincidental interventions will supersede the defendant’s responsibility, except when an independent intervening force was foreseeable.
